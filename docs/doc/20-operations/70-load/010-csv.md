---

The `csv-write` operation writes data to a CSV file. It expects `DataItem` objects with associative arrays; keys become CSV headers (if `has_headers` is true). All `DataItem` objects should have consistent keys for a uniform CSV structure.

## Options

- **file:** The path to the CSV file to write to.
- **delimiter:** (Optional) The character used to separate fields in the CSV file. Defaults to `;`.
- **enclosure:** (Optional) The character used to enclose fields in the CSV file. Defaults to `"`.
- **escape:** (Optional) The character used to escape special characters in the CSV file. Defaults to `\`.
- **has_headers:** (Optional) A boolean indicating whether to write a header row to the CSV file. Defaults to `true`.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `csv-write` operation to save transformed data to a new CSV file:

```yaml
chain:
  - operation: extract-csv
    options:
      path: /path/to/input.csv

  - operation: rule-transformer
    options:
      # Rules to transform the CSV data.
      columns:
        FullName:
          rules:
            - implode:
                values:
                  - { get: { field: "FirstName" } }
                  - { get: { field: "LastName" } }
                with: " "

  - operation: csv-write
    options:
      file: /path/to/output.csv
      delimiter: ","
      has_headers: true
```
