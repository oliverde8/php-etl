The `csv-read` operation reads a CSV file, outputting a `GroupedItem` with an iterator for row-by-row processing. It typically follows an operation providing a file path, like `file-finder`.

The operation receives a `DataItem` that contains the path to the csv file to read. It will return a list DataItem's.
Should e used after a `external file processor` operation.

## Options

- **delimiter:** (Optional) Character separating fields. Defaults to `;`.
- **enclosure:** (Optional) Character enclosing fields. Defaults to `"`.
- **escape:** (Optional) Character escaping special characters. Defaults to `\`.
- **file_key:** (Optional) If input is an array, the key (e.g., `key/subkey`) containing the CSV file path.

  - operation: file-finder
