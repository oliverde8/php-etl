Should e used after a `external file processor` operation.

#### Options

- **enclosure** The csv enclosure character, default value is *'"'*
- **escape** The csv escape character, default value is *'\\'*
- **fileKey** If the DataItem received is an array, the key in which the path to the csv file can be found. "/" can be used to read sub arrays. Example `key/subkey1`.
