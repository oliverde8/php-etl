# ðŸŒŸ 2.0.0 ðŸŒŸ

- :star2: - Complete rewrite of the ChainProcessor
- :star2: - Optimized chain processor not to send as many stop items when multiple chains are involved
- :star2: - Allows ChainProcessor to output through generators the items at the end. This is great to remove all limitations of the current sub chains.
- :star2: - ChainRepeatOperation now can handle more complex cases & asynchronous tasks. The operation is not considered as experimental anymore.
- :star2: - Added FailSafe operation allowing to execute sub-chains and catching exception in them.

- :exclamation: **Deprecation** The chainProcessorInterface was changed significantly.
  - This means any complex custom operations using the chainProcessor needs to be redone. => This shouldn't affect any load/extract or transform operation.
  - This means any integrations using the ETL also needs to be updated.
  - For context, this change was not done lightly, the ETL was initially developed using php5.5. The php language
    has evolved and some complex cases the ETL didn't handle well could be easily fixed by using the new features of
    the language (mostly using Generators).
- :exclamation: **Deprecation** Support for symfony 4 and 5 was dropped.

- :star2: Feature #4 - Added Support to the ChainBuilder for the `Split` operation
- :star2: Feature #4 - new `Merge` operation that works like split but merges back the result of each branch for nex operations.
- :star2: Feature #9 - Added ne Filter operation to filter data.
- :star2: Feature #17 - Add new complex item MixItem. This allows operations to return more than one type of item.
- :star2: Feature #18 - Add new Item FileExtractedItem. Operations extracting data from files should send this item once all the data has been extracted.
- :star2: Feature #19 - Add new Item FileLoadedItem. Operations loading data into files should send this item once all the data has been written.
- :star2: Feature #4 - Add new split item operation
- :star2: Feature #11 - Add a Http client operation using symfony http client.
- :star2: Feature #24 - Added support for Asynchronous Items. The Processor will then wait for the item to finish before transferring it to the next operation.

# 1.0.3
- :wrench: Fix - Stop Item is sent multiple times when using a step returns multiple GroupedItem's
- :star2: Added support for psr/log 2 & 3. (no code needed)

# 1.0.2

# 1.0.1

- :star2: Added support for symfony 6
- :star2: Added better handling of 'execution' files to use as input files or as output files. (See Symfony Bundle)
- :star2: Improve method resolution for chain operations to use types instead of arbitrary names. processData can be names anything now as long as it typed properly
- :wrench: Improve the global quality of the code by having typed methods.

-:exclamation: This will break any of your existing chain declarations: 
 - If you are using the symfony bundle only your custom operations will break (not factories). The context is now an object. 
 - If not the definition of chains remains un changed but both the `ChainBuilder` and `ChainProcessor` has changed.
